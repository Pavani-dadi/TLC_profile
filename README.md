# TLC_Profiles
This code is written on Python 3, which gives the intensity profiles of different spots form a TLC plate.

# Following packages are required for this code

1. NumPy
2. Matplotlib
3. PIL
4. Seaborn
5. skimage
6. Pandas

# INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Install an Anaconda navigator of Python.
2. Open a Jupyter Notebook (version 6.5.4) and Python 3 notebook (ipykernel).
3. Once opened, copy the notebook and import the figure
4. Run the notebook, cell 1, displays the image you've uploaded, cell 2, converts the RGB image to grayscale, cell 3, displays the inverted grayscale image.
5. Before running the cell4, change the number of lanes according to your image.
6. After running cell5, an image will be generated in a diffrent window where you need to select the lanes on the plate for intensity assessement.
7. After the lane selection, a CSV file will be generated.
